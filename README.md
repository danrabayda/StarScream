# Project STARSCREAM: An Approach to Classifying Unlabeled Time-Series Audio Data

An encoding convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to cluster segments of time-series audio and classify them either automatically or by human-in-the-machine interactive exploration.

### To Run:

1. Git clone this repo, then run "./install_tensorflow" to install everything you need for a linux os. If you already have a preferred conda env then just install the pip dependencies with pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Run "conda activate tf" then run "jupyter lab" and open the ipynb


There are several additional functions stored in our pip library StarScreamLib. The functions can be seen in more/StarScreamLib/StarScreamLib/functions.py
