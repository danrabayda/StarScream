# Project STARSCREAM: An Approach to Classifying Unlabeled Time-Series Audio Data

An encoding CNN is used to cluster segments of time-series audio and classify them either automatically or by human-in-the-machine interactive exploration.

### To Run:

1. Install Conda,Tensorflow, and Jupyter Lab as well as the ipynb dependencies in a conda environment called tf with ./install_tensorflow. If you already have a preferred conda env then just install the pip dependencies with pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Run "conda activate tf" then run "jupyter lab" and open the ipynb
